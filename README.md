# Portable Doorbell with Raspberry Pi Pico W

This is a small project for creating a **portable doorbell** using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython.  
When the button is pressed, you receive a **Telegram notification** directly on your phone.

## Firmware

I used MicroPython firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

## Hardware Setup

### Soldering
- Soldered the header pins to the Pico W board.

### Circuit Wiring
- Connected a **10 kΩ resistor** between **3V3** and **GP0**.
- Connected the push button wires:
  - One wire to **GND**
  - The other to **GP0** (the same pin as the resistor)

When the button is pressed, **GP0 goes low**, signaling the button press.

> **Note:** Soldering the resistor is optional. Raspberry Pi Pico W with MicroPython can simulate the button state in software if needed.

## Telegram Integration

- Created a bot using **BotFather** on Telegram.
- Used the bot’s **API token** to send messages.
- Each button press triggers a **Telegram message** to the configured **chat ID**.
